# Tidying up node_modules

[npkill](https://github.com/voidcosmos/npkill) is a useful utility for quickly removing node_modules directories.

Run `npx npkill -s last-mod` from a parent directory to recursively find node_modules folders, sorted by recently used.

Hit space on the entries you want to delete.
