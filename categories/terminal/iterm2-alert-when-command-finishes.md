# Alert when command finishes running in iTerm2

When you run a command that takes a long time to complete, you might want to get on with other stuff and receive an alert when the command finishes.

With iTerm2â€™s [Shell Integration](https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) enabled, run your command, then press `Command-Option-A`, or click *Edit... Marks and Annotations... Alerts... Alert on Next Mark*.
